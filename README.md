h1. Score Watch (until a better name comes to me)

h3. Description
Takes an ESPN Gamecast match ID and scrapes the Gamecast page repeatedly to gather score updates. These are output on the command line and also in Growl (currently via [growlnotify](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify))

h3. TODO
* Stop using Growlnotify in favor of a Ruby growl library
* Allow for command line only
* Scrape a lower-density page for info, such as the day's list of games
* Allow for multiple games to be watched
* Gem it up
